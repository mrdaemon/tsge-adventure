TSGE: Adventure
=================

TSGE: Adventure is the first (of perhaps many) games in the made-up-on-the-spot
TSGE Series. 

It is an adventure game of craptacular quality, in the style of old Infocom
games. You probably won't be eaten by grues, but curious adventures will occur
to you.

Hacking
