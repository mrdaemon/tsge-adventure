TSGE: Adventure
=================

TSGE: Adventure is the first (of perhaps many) games in the made-up-on-the-spot
TSGE Series. 

It is an adventure game of craptacular quality, in the style of old Infocom
games. You probably won't be eaten by grues, but curious adventures will occur
to you.

The game will not be of much interest to anyone until it nears version 1.0.

The program is written in the Vala programming Language.
To build, you need the full valac toolchain, the curses VAPI, and Python.

To build:

 1. ``./configure``
 2. ``make``

These are of course wrappers, the build system used is ``waf``. 
Try ``./waf`` in the root directory.

Special instructions should eventually be available for OS X, which often
depends on MacPorts.
